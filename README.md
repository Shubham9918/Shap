# Shap
Smart Home Automation Project - that really saves energy, digitize your home and makes your life cool &amp; easy.

## the problem->
	Mega watts and Giga watts of power/energy is being wasted, majorly in the transmission and distribution process, due to electricity theft, ancient technology usage, unavailability of funds, expensive energy saving appliances and due to the carelessness of citizens.

## existing solutions->
    Appliances available with star ratings<br/>
    Fake, expensive energy saving devices available in market<br/>
    Installation of electric meters outside house to avoid tampering - LEDs used instead of <br/>conventional light sources
    Solar panels used and motivated etc.<br/>

## Our solution->
# Shap-Smart Home Automation Product
	->It is a IoT product made of up of many electronic devices like arduino, esp8266 and many sensors <br/> and is connected to the internet.
	->It can completely automate the all appliances of our homes (by automatically turning ON/OFF the <br/>light,fans & AC etc when you enter/leave the room).
	-> It consumes negligible electricity.
	-> It is very cost effective.
	->We have build online panel to control all the devices from any of your devices(like cell phones, <br/>laptops & tablat etc) from anywhere in the world.
	->Our online panel have an admin section only for the owner of the house, from where he can control all the devices. 
	->Voice Controllable- User can also control the appliances by voice commands.(we have used voice <br/>controlled tools in physical as well as in digital form).
	->There is also a override button in the panel by which we can completely cut the electricity <br/>power of the house. Suppose if the family is going outside for a trip, then they can turn ON the <br/>override mode. Then nobody can access any of the device in the house. 
	->Security- If anybody tries to make any tampering in the system (like cutting any of the wire) , <br/>then all the appliances of the home will automatically Turn OFF and a tampering alarm will <br/>ring in the admin panel. Nobody can Turn ON the appliances until the owner gives the permission <br/>on his online panel.
	-> Consumption Measurement- It will give you the real time electricity consumption reading on the admin panel.
	-> Appliances Status- It will show the status(whether it is ON/OFF) of all the appliances in the <br/>home by Green/Red color in the online panel.

## usage for any common person - 
	- saves the electricity and so the money.
	- automating the things around
	- provides security to the home.
	- gives accessability to the User from anywhere in the world 
	- can be controlled from any device.
	- measures the power consumption reading also

## Why India needs it -
India is a developing country and shortage of electricity is still a major problem of our country. Elecricity is absent in many of the rural areas of our country till now. If our product (shap) is implemented in the houses of the country , then it will save a huge amount of electricity . Then our govt. will be able to provide electricity in all rural areas of the country. It will actually promote the DIGITAL INDIA campaign.

## Future Use - 
If it is implemented in hostels ,homes , industries then Govt. can access the real power consumption statistics of them and they can make their future plans according to that data.
